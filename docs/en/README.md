## Description

FreeVibes Web is an application I've developed to unify content from multiple music platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, and Last.fm into a single modern and easy-to-use interface. It allows you to search, discover, play, and manage music from various sources without having to switch between different applications.

### Why FreeVibes Web?

- **All-in-one**: Access content from multiple platforms through a single interface
- **No restrictions**: Play FreeVibes without limitations, even in the background
- **Personalized experience**: Create playlists, manage favorites, and discover new music
- **Modern interface**: Clean and intuitive design adaptable to any device

## Features

- **Unified player** for YouTube, Spotify, and Last.fm content
- **Universal search** that retrieves results from multiple sources
- **Personalized recommendations** based on your preferences and history
- **Genre explorer** with categories and recommendations
- **Custom playlists** to organize your music
- **Offline mode** (coming soon)
- **Cross-device synchronization** (coming soon)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 8.x or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher (for the FreeVibes service)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-music-web.git
cd youtube-music-web
```

2. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
```

3. **Install dependencies and run in development**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start all services
npm run dev:all
```

Or if you prefer to start each service separately:

```bash
# Python server (FreeVibes API)
cd python-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Node.js server (Proxy)
cd node-server
npm install
node server.js

# Next.js Frontend
npm run dev
```

4. **Access the application**

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

## Architecture

The system I've designed consists of three main components:

1. **Next.js Frontend** - The main user interface
   - Technologies: Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS
   - Deployed on: Vercel

2. **Node.js Proxy Server** - API to intermediate between the frontend and different sources
   - Technologies: Express, Node.js, Axios
   - Deployed on: Render

3. **FreeVibes API in Python** - Specialized service to access FreeVibes
   - Technologies: Flask, ytmusicapi
   - Deployed on: Render

For more details about the architecture, check the [Technical Documentation](TECHNICAL.md).

## Basic Usage

### Main Navigation

- **Explore**: Discover music by genres, popular artists, and new releases
- **Search**: Find songs, artists, albums, and playlists from multiple sources
- **Library**: Access your favorites, playlists, and playback history
- **Player**: Complete control over playback with queue, repeat, and shuffle

### Universal Search

1. Type your query in the search field
2. Results are displayed grouped by category (songs, artists, albums)
3. Use filters to specify the desired source (YouTube, Spotify, Last.fm)

### Player

- Standard controls: play/pause, previous/next, volume
- Playback queue: view and manage upcoming songs
- Modes: repeat (song/list), shuffle, automix
